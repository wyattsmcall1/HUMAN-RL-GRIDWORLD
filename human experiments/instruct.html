                            The following game is played for twenty episodes in each of four experiments. The goal of the game is to maximize the reward, which is displayed in the current location colored red, by finding the goal and avoiding the pits. The episode ends when either the goal or the pit location is reached. At the end of each experiment, the reward data is saved to a laboratory server. Participants must play the game following these guidelines, and complete the experiments only once, to ensure the integrity of user data.
